# Trivia App with TypeScript (TS)

This is an application to get started writing React with TypeScript. The repository is set up using the Create React App TypeScript template - no need to add TypeScript dependencies into this repo.

This repo utilizes the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) for the trivia questions and answers data.

## Set Up

1. Clone down this repository
1. Change into the `trivia-ts` directory
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
1. Run `npm start` to start the application

## Extension Ideas

* Create `Score` component that keeps track of the player's score.
* Convert the `button` HTML elements for the possible answers into a radio button group with another button to submit the selected answer.
* After 10 questions, give the user a summary of questions they got correct and incorrect.
* Convert/decode the HTML entities that are sometimes in the trivia question or possible answers (like `&quot;`). 
* Create a "loading..." state while a question is being fetched from the API.
* Anything you can think of to make it more fun or personalized!
